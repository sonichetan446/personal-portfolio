# Personal Portfolio

This is my first web development project — a basic personal portfolio page built using HTML and CSS.

## 📁 Files
- `index.html`: Main structure of the page
- `style.css`: Styling the layout

## 🚀 What I Learned
- HTML boilerplate structure
- Linking external CSS
- Creating a basic layout with headings and paragraphs

## 🌐 Live Demo
Coming soon...
